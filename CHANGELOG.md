# Common Data Layer Changelog

## 1.0.0

### Breaking changes
- Data Router expects `version` field in CDL Ingestion Message in format "MAJOR_VERSION.MINOR_VERSION". In this release the only supported version is "1.0".
- Changed ENV variables

### New components
- CDL Web Admin (GUI) - For management purposes only
- Edge Registry (ER) - Manages relationships between schemas (schema to schema) and objects (object to object)
- Materializer - general (M-G) - Writes materialized data to the materialization-database
- Materializer - ondemand (M-O) - Returns materialized data to the user (Request-Response)
- Object Builder (OB) - Creates materialized data based on first stage repositories
- Partial Update Engine (PUE) - Notifies OB when materialized view needs to be processed

### Changes to existing components
- Data Router and Query Router supports static routing allowing Schema-Registry-absent deployment

- Data Router supports message batching

### General changes
- Added gRPC as an alternative communication method between services
