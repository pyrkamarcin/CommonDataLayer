Before you start, you have to have the latest proto files. Tests solution requires proto files placed in the solution folder. 


To do it you can run build.sh script to copy and patch proto files, and also docker image with tests will be created.

## Launch tests
If you use sources 'dotnet test'

If you use build artifacts. 'dotnet vstest CDL.Tests.dll'

Run docker container with tests image. 

'docker run --network host --env-file cdl.env cdl-tests:latest'
