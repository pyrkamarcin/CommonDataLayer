# CDL Management Portal
This is the management portal for the CDL, useful for updating configuration, manipulating data, and viewing performance
data.

## Setup
This site is written with [Svelte.JS][svelte] and [TypeScript][ts]. To run or develop this site, you'll need to
install [NPM][npm]:
I recommend using a version manager to install the latest version like [fnm][fnm], a Rust-based version manager for NPM.

Once you have NPM in your path, run `npm i` in this directory to install all package dependencies.

This app uses [graphql-codegen][codegen] to automatically generate bindings for the CDL's GraphQL API. To generate the
bindings, run
`npx graphql-codegen` with the CDL API running.

## Running
For development, the command `npm run dev` will run a dev server on localhost:5000 (or a random port if 5000 is taken)
which you can access from your local browser.

## Deployment
This site is deployed as a plain folder, specifically the `public`
folder in the root of this repo. Before deploying that folder, make sure to run `npm run build` to build an optimized
version of this site and save it to the `public` directory.
