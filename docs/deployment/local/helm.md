# Helm
For most use cases, using docker-compose is a good way for local development. However, some features can be developed/tested only inside Kubernetes cluster environments.
## Requirements
- [docker][docker-www], [docker-compose][docker-compose-www]
- [kubectl][kubectl-www]
- [minikube][minikube-www] (other type of local Kubernetes cluster may be used, but some commands may differ)
- [helm][helm-www]

## Setting up local cluster
### Start the cluster
Decide how many resources can be used by the local k8s cluster and start it.

Note: Resources aren't blocked if k8s cluster is idle, parent system can still use them. It's recommended to use all/almost all the available CPUs because rust compilation takes place in this environment(and it can take a while, especially on a release build).

`minikube start --cpus 8 --memory 8192 --driver=docker`

## Building docker image
The next step is to build docker images which will be used by k8s pods.

```shell
eval $(minikube docker-env)
ENV=PROD DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1 ./build.sh
```

The first command will change the docker daemon we're communicating with to docker inside minikube. From now on, any docker command run from the current shell will be executed inside minikube docker daemon. To connect to your standard docker daemon, just start a new shell. Second command builds docker image. On the first time building, it will be considerably longer than any following rebuild. You can change `ENV=PROD` to `ENV=DEV` if you want shorter build time(in cost of less performant output).

## Spin up infrastructure services
To start, necessary infrastructure(not necessary if you've deployed infrastructure yourself/you want to connect to
services on our azure cluster):

`helm install --values ./deployment/helm/infrastructure/values.yaml infrastructure ./deployment/helm/infrastructure`

If you want to use druid repository, you also need to start druid.
`helm install --values ./deployment/helm/infrastructure-druid/values.yaml infrastructure-druid ./deployment/helm/infrastructure-druid`

## Installing CDL
To install the solution, you need to execute:

`helm install --values ./helm/cdl/values-local.yaml cdl ./deployment/helm/cdl`

After a moment, Kubernetes pods should get started. You can check their status by `kubectl get pods`

Note: Using default `values.yaml` file(or skipping this parameter) will install configuration for our cloud cluster.
## Removing CDL
To remove current installation of CDL, you can use:

`helm uninstall cdl`

This operation will take ~30 seconds(default Kubernetes timeout).
## Upgrading CDL
The easiest way to update the whole deployment is to uninstall it, rebuild docker image and reinstall the helm chart.

## Useful commands
- `minikube list services` - list services running on minikube(port numbers for input, output etc.)
- `minikube dashboard` - runs web dashboard of the Kubernetes cluster
- `kubectl get pods` - get list of pods
- `kubectl exec cdl-rust-storage-0 -it -- /bin/ash` - run commands directly on single k8s pod
- `kubectl logs cdl-rust-storage-0` - get logs generated by pod
- `kubectl describe pod cdl-rust-storage-0` - gets more information about a pod, may contain info why pod is not
  starting etc.

## Troubleshooting
Few problems you might encounter during development on local k8s cluster:

### TLS errors while running docker commands
Sometimes(if minikube isn't properly stopped) it changes cluster address. This results with errors while trying to
connect to minikube docker daemon. In order to fix it we have to restart the daemon.
_This issue should be fixed on current minikube version._
