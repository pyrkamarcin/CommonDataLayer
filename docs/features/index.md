# Features

## Guidelines
* `name or description` field demonstrates only brief info about the feature itself, to learn more, please follow to the RFC in question.
* There may be multiple RFCs/documents for each feature, but usually only one will be linked here.
* Generally, the state of the feature looks should follow these guidelines:
  - `[discussion/idea/request]->[TechSpec/RFC] and optionally [PoC] -> [RC] -> [Ready]`
  - `RC` means that the feature is waiting for the release
  - `Ready` means that the feature is tested, merged and released
  - `Retired` means that the feature was dropped due to various factors, including but not limited to lack of support, legacy code or lack of usage.
  - `Suggestion` means the feature was requested or suggested, and is in preplanning or plannig stage. This shoud result in a Technical Specification or in a doc.
  - Features in `TechSpec` phase can have missing or broken document links, since documentation is usually waiting for pull request or have additional comments pending.

* in case there is a developmnent release we will mark it as XXX-rc, those are not fully fledged releases, a lot of the things can be broken there or undergoing testing
  this is basically a beta branch that may or may not result in stabilization and/or release. As such State for those features will remain `RC` until released to master
