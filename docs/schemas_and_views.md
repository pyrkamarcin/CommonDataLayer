# Schemas and Views

## Schemas
Schemas are the format in which data is to be sent to the Common Data Layer. Each schema is assigned a random UUID on
creation and initially is created with a name and an initial definition. The name is not required to be unique among all
schemas (as the UUID is the unique identifier of schemas), but is simply for identifying the schema when searching for
schemas. It can be updated at any time.

The definition is a [JSON Schema][json schema] document that describes the expected format of data stored under the
given schema. It is assigned the semantic version 1.0.0, and cannot be updated after creation. Rather, updates can be
made to the definition by inserting another definition with a new semantic version strictly larger than any other
existing version assigned to that schema.

When validating data against a schema, either the latest version of the definition is used, or optionally a semantic
version range can be provided, and the latest version meeting the range is used.

Schemas can also have multiple views, described below.

An example of a CDL schema might be:

```json
{
  "id": "<schema UUID>",
  "name": "Vector",
  "definitions": {
    "1.0.0": {
      "x": "number",
      "y": "number",
      "z": "number"
    },
    "1.0.0": {
      "w": "number",
      "x": "number",
      "y": "number",
      "z": "number"
    }
  },
  "views": [
    "<view 1 UUID>",
    "<view 2 UUID>",
    "<view 3 UUID>"
  ]
}
```

## Views
Views describe projections of data defined by a specific schema. As with schemas, each view is assigned a UUID on
creation and initially is created with a name and an initial definition. Like schemas, the name is a vanity name for
searching purposes only and can be updated at any time, as the UUID is the unique identifier used. On creation, a view
is assigned to a schema and cannot be assigned to a different one.

The definition is a [JMESPath][jmespath] expression which describes how to project data defined under the parent schema
into the desired output format. Unlike with schemas, view definitions are editable at any time and are not versioned,
though this feature may be added in the future.

An example of a CDL view might be:

```json
{
  "id": "<view UUID>",
  "name": "two dimensions",
  "definition": "{ x: x, y: y }"
}
```
