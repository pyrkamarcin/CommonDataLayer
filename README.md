# Common Data Layer
A collection of microservices that make up the Common Data Layer, implemented in the [Rust][rust] language.

# What is Common Data Layer?
Common Data Layer (in short `cdl`) is multipurpose and multi-format, cloud native, abstract database application. It
enables user to store, read and materialize `documents`, `timeseries data` and `blobs` without the need to worry about
individual database APIs.

# Documentation
See [book][book] for more information how to use it and deploy.

# Quickstart
Read [configuration README](./.cdl/README.md)
and [configuration docs](https://epiphany-platform.github.io/CommonDataLayer/configuration/index.html).

CDL can be ran on k8s, on docker or on bare metal.

## k8s
Please refer to [documentation](https://epiphany-platform.github.io/CommonDataLayer/deployment/local/helm.html).
> Note that currently helm does not use `.cdl` directory for configuration

## docker
CDL images are available on [dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/u/epiphanyplatform).  
Configuration can be added via docker volumes. Please keep in mind that it is likely that you'll have to review domain
names and ports.

## bare metal
CDL does not provide binaries for bare metal deployments. Binaries can be built manually via command:

```bash
cargo build --workspace
```

> As bare metal isn't really documented (and supported, however it's there for local testing), in case of problems feel free to open a discussion on our github repo
