# Testing

This directory contains integration tests for *CDL* components.

Making sure they pass is vital to longevity of our application.

## Prerequisites

### Python
Tests run on python `3`. They are tested on CI using python `3.8`.

### Pip
We require `pip` to be present in `$PATH`. Some python installations, especially when you are keeping both `python2` and `python3`
on your machine, tend to reserve `pip` as `python2` package manager. Before using, please ensure whetreh that's the case on your system.
If it is, please adjust executable name to `pip3` in following commands, or symlink `pip3` to `pip`

### Rust & Cargo
Tests don't compile *CDL*. You have to do it yourself, and either install *CDL* binaries into your `$PATH` or point tests to binaries via env variables.

Supported env variables are:

| application | env |
|---|---|
| db-shrinker-postgres | DB_SHRINKER_POSTGRES_EXE |
| command-service | COMMAND_SERVICE_EXE |

### Docker and docker-compose
We test using [testcontainers python library](https://pypi.org/project/testcontainers/), which spins up new docker environment for every test.
For this reason, docker and docker-compose must be present on the machine in order to run these tests.

## Running
First we need to initialize environment from `requirements.txt` located at the top of project directory.
We do that by running `pip install -r ../requirements.txt`.

`pytest` discovers tests and runs them all.

## Structure
 
### ./data
Folder with test data, divided into directories per application

### application folders
eg. db_shrinker_postgres. Named after application they test.
