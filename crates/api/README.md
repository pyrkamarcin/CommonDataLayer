# Getting started
You can deploy web api on local computer via `docker-compose`. For more
see [documentation](../deployment/compose/README.md).

You can access interactive graphQL editor at http://localhost:50106/graphiql. It supports auto-completion, has built-in
documentation explorer and history.

Because our schema-registry is automatically initialized with some schemas, you can start making queries right away,
like:

``` graphql
{
    schemas {
      id,
      definitions {
        version,
        definition
      },
      views {
        expression
      }
    }
}
```
